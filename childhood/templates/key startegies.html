                <h1>Key strategies for teaching</h1>  
                <p>Maria Montessori believed that the six first years of a child are vital to a child's development (Nolan & Raban, 2015). The absorbent mind is a term used to describe the period in which a child learns by absorbing information from their environment and sensory stimuli (Montessori Australia, n.d).</p>

                <h1>Role of the Montessori teacher</h1>
                <p>The role of a Montessori teacher is to guide and support children in their process of learning. The teacher observes, monitors, analyse each child's learning and development, and introduce children to Montessori materials. This occurs through three-period lessons wherein the educators use the progression book to record the children’s learning (Montessori Australia, n.d).</p>

            <h1>Learning</h1>
            <p>Learning is focused on three imperative foundations: care for the environment, care for oneself as an individual, and care for others in the community (Nolan & Raban, 2015). However, other key curriculum learning areas of the Montessori approach are practical life-learning materials that encourage children to be independent, develop gross and fine motor skills, concentrate, develop social skills, and care for the environment (Montessori Academy, n.d). <br> Examples are sweeping, pouring, tonging, and spooning.</p>

                Indirect aim: The child learns how to sort and classify and explore maths and language concepts (Montessori Academy, n.d ). <br>
                Examples are colour box, brown stairs, baric tablet, pink tower.

                Language - learning materials provided develops children knowledge and skills on language concepts. This includes reading, writing and verbal language. Children learn letter identification, formation, and letter sound, and how to build three-letter words and sentences. Oral verbal language skills are fostered through group time experiences and social interactions that occur daily (Montessori Academy, n.d.). <br> Examples include three-part cards, moveable alphabet, and sandpaper letters.

                Examples of materials include life cycle, continent boxes, and map cabinets.

            <h1>Assessment</h1>
            <p>The teacher observes each child learning. The Australian Children’s Education and Care Quality Authority (ACECQA, 2018) and National Quality Standard 1.3.1 (ACECQA, 2020) encourages educators to assess each child learning and development. However, the standard does not state how any observation per month for each child.</p>
            <p>A Montessori observation can be completed for each child, and it will be aligned with the learning story type of formative assessment. In addition, Montessori progression will be added to the learning story and the children's progression at either (introduced, presented and mastery). This can be represented in a triangle.</p>
            <p>Developmental milestones are completed half quarterly for children above the age of 3 years and half-yearly for children under 2. Developmental milestones assist educators in assessing children's learning and play and highlighting any concerns that need to be addressed on a child's development (Department of Education and Training, n.d.).</p>
            <p>Summative assessments are completed half-yearly. NSW Department of Education (2020) defines summative assessment as the assessment that indicates a learner achievement against the learning outcomes. The learning outcomes include the learning outcomes indicate in the Early Years Learning Framework (Department of Education and Training, 2019).</p>
            <p>Educators use a recording sheet to outline the materials or learning that occurred for each child. Additionally, the recording sheet has an intentional teaching column in which educators outline intentional teaching that occurred.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <h1>Planning</h1>
            <p>Since the Montessori curriculum is linked to the Early Years Learning Framework, the planning cycle is also followed.</p>
            <h6><u><i>Observe/ collecting information</i></u></h6>
            <p>Educators observe children. Educators use different formative assessments to collect the information</p>
            <h6><u><i>Analysing information</i></u></h6>
            <p>Educators analyse each child learning and play. The Education and Care Services National Regulation 72(1a) encourages educators to assess children developmental needs, experiences, participation, interest against the outcomes of the program (Education and Care Services National Regulations 2011 (SI 653)).</p>
            <h6><u><i>Planning</i></u></h6>
            <p>Educators plan experiences to extend children's skills, knowledge, and interest. In a Montessori environment, children progress to the following Montessori material if they have achieved mastery or are presented with a Montessori material or have the opportunity to work with the material again. All stakeholders are encouraged to participate in planning. ACECQA (2016) states that involvement of all stakeholders in planning ensures t participation, effective and nurturing relationships and identify children that need further assistance in achieving the learning outcomes.</p>
            <h6><u><i>Implementing</i></u></h6>
            <p>The learning experiences are implemented. Opportunities are offered for children to engage in play.</p>

            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <p>According to the Department of Education and Training (2019), critical reflection is an essential aspect of ongoing learning. Through reflection, educators can make informed decisions about children's learning. Educators examine what occurs in the service, children's learning, and question if the change is a need in the learning environment or teaching practices. Additionally, add nqf1. Engaging in ongoing reflection assist educator to evaluate the effectiveness of learning experiences, environment and opportunities provided to children and families.</p>
            <p>In a Montessori environment, educators are encouraged to reflect on children learning each day on the curriculum sheets and reflect on what learning occurred, their teaching practices, or anything relevant to the running of the service.</p>
