                <h1>The role of the program model on the provision of early childhood education across the globe</h1>
                <h4>(Wynnia Medina)</h4>
                <p>Montessori education is identified as one of the most well-known models for unconventional early childhood education alongside Waldorf and Reggio Emilia education. Remarkably, Montessori educational strategy became strongly well-liked in Italy and United States in the short term. Montessori’s own ideologies towards child development and learning are relatively specific and historically intense and are frequently specified as a framework to characterize other educational theories. Lillard (1997), Deluca and Hughes (2014) argued that Montessori acknowledges each child’s development based on their interests, pacing and skills. Montessori imagined early childhood educators’ objective is to value children’s self-worth by recognising the developmental significance of their unsolicited activity as part of extended childhood. Montessori approaches have been mentioned to be a motivation for developing educational reform in the United States and all over the world (Aljabreen, 2020).</p>
                <p>Likewise, it should be well thought of that Montessori education aims to allow every child’s holistic development (cognitive, language, social, emotional, and physical) to extend. Currently, there is a contradicting aim of most educational systems as they more emphasize increasing performances in academic subjects including literacy and numeracy. In addition, although the Montessori approach is integrated into various educational systems nowadays, it is commonly used without full confirmation. Moreover, it can also be argued that issues can arise in completely implementing an educational approach that emerged over 1—a year ago, in a world now that is constantly changing. Research suggests that children are more likely to gain benefit cognitively and socially from Montessori education. For instance, in a Montessori approach, teaching literacy through phonetic strategy and providing tangible objects for learning mathematics is highly effective. Additionally, the absence of extrinsic rewards and minimal focus on academic evaluation are some of the key factors of Montessori education when implemented during the early childhood years of education. Therefore, it is important for Montessori educators to critically understand and reflect on the current evidence that supports or does not their pedagogical practices (Marshall, 2017).</p>

                <p>Montessori education provides children with life-long benefits that help them to achieve their goals. The Montessori preprepared environment is designed considering the children's physical and psychological developmental needs (Montessori Australia, n.d.). Montessori teaching toys present in classrooms promote hands-on activity and provoke children’s logical thoughts. The Montessori method of education provides children with an aesthetic environment that encourages them to be independent and develop autonomy. In Montessori educational settings, children have the freedom to do what they want to do as long as it is not interfering with another's freedom (Montessori Australia, n.d.).</p>

                <p>The Montessori program plays a crucial role in the provision of early childhood education within Australia. In Australia, Montessori education offers programmes for children age eight weeks to eighteen years. These programmes have been delivered through early childhood education and care centres, kindergartens, preschools, primary and secondary schools all over Australia. According to Montessori Australia (n.d.), there are more than 335 Montessori schools and centres educating approximately 23,000 students across the country. Most of these early childhood education and care settings are not-for-profit and community-based associations. In addition, the number of privately owned centres and public schools is constantly increasing. Montessori programmes are also running in remote areas of Australia (Montessori Australia, n.d.). Montessori philosophy collaborates with the culture and heritage of First peoples to serve children and families in indigenous Australian communities. Hence, Montessori is a method of education that can be implemented in culturally and religiously diverse environments and a range of educational settings such as preschools, long day care services, public, independent, and religious schools. According to Montessori Australia (n.d.), in recent years Montessori approach has been incorporated by religious and secular centres in Australia. In addition, the patients living with traumatic and brain injuries or dementia have been supported and benefitted by this approach due to its centredness and personhood behaviour (Montessori Australia, n.d.).</p>

                <h4>(Pardeep Kaur)</h4>
                <p>According to the National Law and Regulations, early childhood education services should develop their educational programme based on an approved learning framework (Australian Children’s Education and Care Quality Authority, n.d.). In Australia, Early Years Learning Framework (EYLF) is a national approved learning framework for children from birth to five years of age (Department of Education and Training, 2019). According to Montessori Academy (2021), Montessori education works collaboratively with the Australian Government's Early Years Learning Framework (EYLF) to support children's development and learning from birth to the age of six. Montessori Australia has developed Montessori Early Years Learning Programme (MEYLP) that eloquent the mapping of the Montessori curriculum against EYLF. MEYLP shows how the Montessori curriculum meets the learning outcomes describes in EYLF and addresses children's developmental needs, desires and interests considering individual differences (Montessori Australia, n.d.). In Montessori-based childcare centres, the children are provided with the autonomy to learn and use the material independently. Montessori education provides children with age-appropriate educational tools and allows them to choose their own work and learning (Montessori Australia, n.d.).</p>
