            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <h4>(Ma. Erika Radomes)</h4>
            <p>Maria Montessori was a person of great depth and insight. Her deep commitment to   the   children had   led   her   to   become   a   champion   in   the   research   and   development   of   education   (Murray,   Johnston,   Sabater   &   Clark,   2020).   Her conclusion  that  children  have  a  natural  love  of  learning  which  needed  to  be  nurtured and not taken for granted has then also led her to create an approach to learning  that  emphasises  active  learning,  independence,  and  cooperation that support to open the door in developing each child’s unique pace of development (Murray  et  al.,  2020).  This  is  why  her  philosophy  was  put  into  practice  and  her legacy to the children at this present time has spread in thousands of Montessori schools worldwide (Bennets & Bone, 2020).</p>
            
            <h1>Historical influences, influential people, date/period of conception</h1>
            <h4>(Ma. Erika Radomes)</h4>
            <p>Maria Montessori was born on August 31, 1870, in Chiaravalle, Italy. She was one of the first female doctors of the 19th century and graduated from the University of Rome’s medical program (Romano, 2020). Maria Montessori is one of the most influential names in the history of the development of early childhood education and is  considered as one of the controversial figures or leading advocates of early childhood education   that developed a renowned   method   of   schooling(Montessori,  Hunt  &  Valsiner,  2017).  Her  perspectives  towards  early  childhood education has started when she was influenced by two French doctors, Jean Itard and  Edouard  Seguin,  during  her  research  studies  while  she  was treating special needs children. She was also impacted by a variety of theorists, most particularly Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Froebel but two of note were also her teacher Sergi and educationalist Pestalozzi (Bone, 2017). Although Maria Montessori started as a physician that is specialised in paediatrics and psychiatry, it was her experiences with children with special needs, and children of the working class and poor thathas convinced her to create her own pedagogical system and method of teachingin early childhood education (Romano, 2020). This is why her careful observations towards them have led her to develop theories on how children learn best (Bone, 2017).  This  is  because  as  she  was  working  with  them,  she  found  out that intelligence  is  rare  and  that  children naturally  come  into  the world with human potential that has the desire to improve themselves and love work (Povell, 2017).Through  her  scientific  observation  of  using  the  children’s  practical  life  and  sensorial materials, Maria Montessori has also found out that classical methods were not always effective which is why she had developed a system of education that  focuses  on  the  children’s natural  curiosity,  innate  intrigue,  and  interests(Montessori et al., 2017). This is also the reason why she always gives the children freedom to independently explore, however, in a carefully prepared environmentwith  interesting  activities  because  these  are  the  vital  factors  that  support  the  children to further grow and learn (Lillard, 2018). Due to her great contribution to the  world  of  education,  this  then  post  dives  into  the  development  of  the Montessori method of education (Lillard, 2020). Until Maria Montessori’s death at the age of eighty-one, she continued to develop her philosophy which is why she  use  it  to  lecture  worldwide,  published  many  books,  trained  teachers,  and established the standards of what is now knows as the Montessori method. Maria Montessori then died in Holland on the 6th of May 1952 (Murray et al., 2020).</p>
          
            <h1>Theoretical underpinnings and curriculum ideologies</h1>
            <h4>(Ma. Erika Radomes)</h4>
            <p>Observation,  or  watching  the  children  how  they  are  enjoying  themselves  and  exploring their environment is the simple method of how Maria Montessori has learned about children and developed her theories on child development (Bone, 2017). This is why in her observations of children, she identified developmental phases wherein each has its own set of goals for learning such as the development of  an  individual  self,  social  development,  the  birth  of  the  adult  phase  and  the  mature  phase  (O’Donnell,  2014).  According  to  her,  the  children  are  driven  to  acquire  certain  skills  during  each  phase  and  these  phases  or  stages  are  the  windows  of  opportunity  or  what  she  also called “sensitive  periods”  (Catherine, Javier & Francisco, 2020, para. 1). This is an important period of the children’s life because,  during  this  period,  the  children  learn  specific  information  and  skills(Montessori  et  al.,  2017).  Hence,  when  this  information  and  skills  are  not  being  taught  to  the  children  through  exposure  and  repetition,  their  hardware  in  the  brain  will  not  wire  upright  (Gu,  2020).  This  is  why  the  Montessori  method  is  designed around three important key points which are the teacher, the child, and the environment (Saracho & Evans, 2021). In the Montessori classroom, each child works   at   his   own   pace   and   any   assistance   from   other   children   happens   spontaneously (Topic & Colak, 2018). On the other hand, there is no pressure from teachers  to  work  faster  but  instead,  their  primary  role  is  to  offer  support  and  guidance for building the skills as needed. This is why the curriculum ideologies of Montessori  is  in  construction  in  proportion  to  every  child’s  needs  (Sosnowska, 2020). In Montessori classes, the children are consisting of different ages wherein three-year age range are within each class that starts from 0 to 3, 3 to 6, 6 to 9, and 9- to 12-year-old children (Saracho & Evans, 2021). These are the Montessoricycles,  and  this  also  means  that  even  the  directors  of  the  Montessori  school  remain with the same group for the entire three-year cycle to get to know each of the children better (Romano, 2020). For the program of the children ages 0 to 3,  they  are  more  on  the  development  of  a movement  which  is  why  physical  movement   activities   are   being   implemented   at   this   age   group   to   help   in developing their coordination and locomotion (Gu, 2020). In contrast to the age of 3  to  6,  they  focus  more  on  their  work  on  materials  that  develop  cognition  through their senses and direct experience (Gascoyne, 2019). On the other hand, the primary-age children in the upper-grade level shift away from the concrete, or sensorial experience so that they can focus more on abstract tasks. Moreover, they also explore the same subjects being taught in other schools such as Science, Math,  Languages  and  History,  yet  the  approach  to  these  subjects  is  different,  allowing the children to fully explore the topic but they are not being restricted to discrete  parts  separate  from the whole  so  that  they  can  immensely  understand  the concepts of the subjects as the term progresses (Maghfiroh, 2021).</p>
